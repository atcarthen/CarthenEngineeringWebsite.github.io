Intended for educational purposes this website was created to bring in the vast expertise that I have. 3 years out of college, working on the fourth I have experience many different hats from technical writer to developer. I now set my aims on PLCs, Electric circuits and Cybersecurity as I have worked on these skills in tandem as the content will reflect. Please use this as an example to market your self.

Allow the world to be inspired by you as you will inspire others.
